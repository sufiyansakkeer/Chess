# Test Plan for Game State Validation Logic

This document outlines the test plan for the game state validation logic in the chess application. The focus is on testing the `isCheck`, `isCheckmate`, and `isStalemate` methods in the `GameStateManager` class, as well as the helper methods used by these methods.

## Test Areas

### 1. `isCheck` Method

- **Purpose:** To verify that the `isCheck` method correctly identifies when the king is in check.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Different board configurations where the king is in check.
    - King in check by a rook.
    - King in check by a knight.
    - King in check by a bishop.
    - King in check by a queen.
    - King in check by a pawn.
    - King in check by multiple pieces.
  - Different board configurations where the king is not in check.

### 2. `isCheckmate` Method

- **Purpose:** To verify that the `isCheckmate` method correctly identifies when the king is in checkmate.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Different board configurations where the king is in checkmate.
    - King has no valid moves and is under attack.
    - King has valid moves but is still under attack (all valid moves lead to check).
    - Specific known checkmate patterns (e.g., Scholar's Mate, Fool's Mate).
  - Different board configurations where the king is not in checkmate.

### 3. `isStalemate` Method

- **Purpose:** To verify that the `isStalemate` method correctly identifies when the game is in stalemate.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Different board configurations where the game is in stalemate.
    - King has no valid moves and is not under attack.
    - Other pieces have no valid moves and the king is not under attack.
  - Different board configurations where the game is not in stalemate.

### 4. Helper Methods

- **Purpose:** To verify that the helper methods used by the validation logic are working correctly.
- **Test Cases:**
  - `isKingInCheck`: Test with different board configurations to ensure it correctly identifies if the king is in check.
  - `_isSquareUnderAttack`: Test with different board configurations to ensure it correctly identifies if a square is under attack.
  - `_hasAnyValidMoves`: Test with different board configurations to ensure it correctly identifies if a player has any valid moves.

## Test Data

Test data will consist of various board configurations represented as 2D arrays of `PieceEntity` objects. These configurations will be designed to cover all the scenarios outlined in the test plan.

## Test Environment

- Flutter SDK
- Dart testing framework

## Test Execution

Tests will be executed using the Dart testing framework. Test results will be analyzed to identify any bugs or issues in the game state validation logic.

## Test Reporting

A test report will be generated summarizing the test results, including the number of tests executed, the number of tests passed, and the number of tests failed. Any bugs or issues identified during testing will be documented in the test report.
